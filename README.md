This project is a simple awareness webpage developed as part of a Virtual Internship in Basics of Web Development. 
The webpage provides an overview of the Digital India initiative, covering its objectives, key components, and benefits in a structured and easy-to-understand format.
The project uses HTML to create the webpage structure, CSS to apply professional styling and layout, and JavaScript to add basic interactivity through a button that displays an alert and redirects users to an external reference page. 
The focus of this project is to strengthen fundamental front-end development skills while creating an informative and user-friendly awareness webpage.
