            <h3>What is Digital India?</h3>
            <p>Digital India is a flagship initiative launched by the Government of India with the vision of transforming the country into a digitally empowered society and a knowledge-based economy. The main aim of this initiative is to ensure that government services are made available to citizens electronically by improving online infrastructure and increasing internet connectivity across the nation. Digital India focuses on bridging the digital divide between urban and rural areas by providing equal access to digital resources, especially in remote and underdeveloped regions. Through various digital platforms such as online portals, mobile applications, and digital payment systems, citizens can easily access essential services like banking, education, healthcare, and government schemes. The initiative also promotes digital literacy, enabling people to use technology confidently and effectively in their daily lives. By reducing paperwork, increasing transparency, and improving efficiency in governance, Digital India plays a crucial role in modernizing India and supporting sustainable economic growth.
